          <h2>Why to upgrade to Rails 7</h2>
          <p>
          None of the versions of Rails from 4.1 and below are supported anymore by the Rails Community after the release of Rails 7. It is implied that the bug fixes shall also be released only for Rails 5.0.x and 7.0.x So, if you have not yet upgraded to any of these two versions, now would be the perfect time to do so if you do not want to leave your applications vulnerable to the bugs that have no fixes available anymore. Now’s the best time to embark on your Rails upgrade journey! This is because now that v7.x is out and widely in use, v3.x is no longer receiving any further updates be it even a critical security update. So, it will not be wise in such a case to wait for a grave security issue to arise and trigger your upgrade process. Do not let your business and customers become vulnerable even for the time that it will take to upgrade once such a security vulnerability is discovered. Reason enough to upgrade to rails 7 now. As you begin to upgrade your application, here are few pro tips that help ensure a smooth process.

          <h2>How To Move To Ruby On Rails 7.0.X</h2>
          <h3>Only Ruby 2.2.2 and above is supported by the latest Ruby on Rails version</h3>
          <p>
          Just like all the other latest versions, Rails 7.0.X promotes the use of the latest version of Ruby by the Rails community. 7.0.X version will only work with Ruby 2.2.2 and above. This Ruby version upgrade also plays a role in performance improvement for your Ruby on Rails Application making use of the new improved Ruby garbage collector.
          </p><br><br>
          <h3>Consider upgrading your existing Ruby on Rails App to the latest version</h3>
          <p>It goes without saying that you must build your new Rails application on the latest version. In addition to that, you should also consider the feasibility of upgrading your existing application to the latest version.</p>
          <br><br>
          <h3>Execute the upgrade by one version at a time</h3>
          <p>For any version below 4.2.x, it is important to carry out a multi-stage upgrade in which you would upgrade one version at a time. This is important because otherwise you are likely to miss out on some of the most critical deprecation warnings and this can easily run you into security issues and vulnerabilities that are hard to debug because that behavior might have been completely removed.</p><br><br>
          <h3>Upgrade your entire Rails Development environment</h3>
          <p>Don’t just upgrade your Rails version but also, take care to upgrade your entire Rails development environment by setting up the most current version of all the gems that you may need for development</p>
          <br>
          <p>We know that in the fast changing world of software, you may not be holding the highest priority for the version upgrades, however, staying fairly up to date helps you keep your costs for the upgrade at minimum by choosing to make small frequent upgrades over rare but massive upgrades that might make the entire process unnecessarily complicated.</p><br>
          <p>If you are considering a version upgrade while reading this, we would love to address to all your queries and concerns in this regard, small or big. Even if you are not yet convinced that the process of executing an upgrade is not worth its development hours, feel free to share your opinion with us. As an actively involved organization in the Ruby on Rails research and development, we are open and looking forward for you to share your experiences with us.</p>
